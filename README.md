## Project Overview

- Estate Nest is a comprehensive real estate platform designed with three distinct dashboards: one for administrators, another for agents, and one for users. Users can browse property details added by agents and verified by administrators. They can leave reviews, add properties to their wishlist, and make offers within the agent's specified price range. Upon acceptance by the agent, users can proceed to purchase the property. Additionally, users can manage their wishlists, reviews, and view their purchased properties.

Agents can add new properties, monitor their listings, track sold properties, and manage property requests. Administrators oversee user management, property listings, property advertising, and review moderation.

## Major Features

- **User Dashboard**: Users can make offers on properties within the agent's specified price range. If the agent accepts the offer, users can proceed with payment to purchase the property.
- **Agent Dashboard**: Agents can add properties that will be verified by admin, track and view details of sold properties, including the total amount from sales.
- **Admin Dashboard**:  Admins can manage user roles, identify and mark fraudulent agents (resulting in removal of their properties and a change in their role status), and promote properties on the homepage through advertising.
